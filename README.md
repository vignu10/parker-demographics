ðŸš— Implementation Documentation: Metropolis Demographics Notebook

The metropolis_demographics.ipynb notebook implements a predictive pipeline that processes parked vehicle data and uses a regression model to estimate vehicle price. Based on this prediction, vehicles are categorized into tiers (Luxury, Mid-Level, Economy), enabling demographic segmentation of city locations.

ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Implementation Breakdown

1. Library Imports

The notebook begins by importing:
	â€¢	pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
	â€¢	matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
	â€¢	sklearn for machine learning tasks (like regression).
	â€¢	requests if used for optional API calls.

2. Loading and Preparing the Dataset

A CSV dataset containing parked car records is loaded. Each row includes:
	â€¢	make, model, and year of the vehicle.
	â€¢	parking_start and parking_end times.
	â€¢	location of the parking.

Datetime columns are converted to proper datetime objects and used to calculate parking duration in hours.

3. Feature Engineering

The dataset is enriched with useful features such as:
	â€¢	Parking duration (end - start).
	â€¢	Time of day buckets (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
	â€¢	Encoded categorical values (make, model, year) for regression modeling.

4. Vehicle Price Prediction Using Regression

A machine learning regression model (like Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting Regressor) is trained using a labeled dataset where actual vehicle prices are known (e.g., from scraped or downloaded price databases).

Features used in the model include:
	â€¢	Make
	â€¢	Model
	â€¢	Year
	â€¢	Possibly location and duration as proxies for wear/use

Once trained, the model predicts the price of each vehicle in the main dataset.

5. Vehicle Tier Classification Based on Predicted Price

After price prediction:
	â€¢	Vehicles with a predicted price above $50,000 are labeled Luxury.
	â€¢	Between $20,000â€“$50,000 are labeled Mid-Level.
	â€¢	Below $20,000 are labeled Economy.

This dynamic classification is more robust and adaptable than static price thresholds, as the regression model can account for nuanced differences between vehicles.

6. Time-of-Day Classification

Each record is assigned a time-of-day category based on the parking start time:
	â€¢	Morning: 6 AM to 12 PM
	â€¢	Afternoon: 12 PM to 5 PM
	â€¢	Evening: 5 PM to 9 PM
	â€¢	Night: 9 PM to 6 AM

This helps infer behavior such as work vs home parking.

7. Location-Based Aggregation

The dataset is grouped by location, and the proportion of cars in each tier is calculated per area. This allows mapping of socio-economic profiles across different zones.

â¸»

8. Visualization

A stacked bar chart is generated where:
	â€¢	The x-axis represents different locations.
	â€¢	Each bar shows the proportion of vehicle tiers (Luxury, Mid-Level, Economy) in that location.

This visualization reveals the wealth concentration and parking behavior per region.

â¸»

ðŸ“ˆ Output
	â€¢	A processed dataset with predicted prices and tier classification.
	â€¢	A demographic breakdown by location, based on vehicle tiers.
	â€¢	Visual summaries showing socio-economic tiers using parking data.

ðŸ§  Conclusion

This notebook implements a predictive pipeline that infers demographic patterns from parked vehicle data using a machine learning regression model to estimate vehicle price. It translates seemingly simple vehicle parking logs into deep insights about wealth distribution, neighborhood types, and visitor patterns.
